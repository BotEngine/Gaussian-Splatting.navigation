# Gaussian-Splatting.navigation
A navigation system that uses Gaussian Splatting to identify a player's location and move towards an objective! Each area that's separated by a door or loading screen is it's own "unit of work". # game: Example: Star Citizen When you respawn it will use this to leave your hospital room, then resets to new to find the elevator, then resets when exit
